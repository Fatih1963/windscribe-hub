# ⚠️ Important Notice

The Windscribe Proxy SDK is currently under active development in a separate project.  

Once the SDK reaches a stable and production-ready state, development of the **Windscribe Hub** project will begin here in this repository.  

At present, this repository does not contain any active SDK code or stable releases. It serves as the future home for the Windscribe Hub, which depends on the completion of the SDK.  

Please do not expect to find usable code here yet, and avoid using this repository in production environments until the SDK is complete and the Hub project is officially underway.  

Thank you for your understanding and support as we progress through these stages.

— The Windscribe Team
